HOW TO PLAY THE GAME
--------------------

Guess what items are in the room to turn on the light! Type a word. If the
image appears in red, the item was rejected. If it appears in green, it was
accepted. There is a rule for what words are accepted. The rule is picked at
random. You have to figure out the rule and submit 5 accepted items in a row
to win. The room is then revealed.

(Note that repeating the same item 5 times will not work.)
