HOW TO PLAY THE GAME
--------------------

Guess what items are in the room to turn on the light! Type a word. If the
image appears in red, the item was rejected. If it appears in green, it was
accepted. There is a rule for what words are accepted. The rule is picked at
random. You have to figure out the rule and submit 5 accepted items in a row
to win. The room is then revealed.

Note that repeating the same item 5 times will not work.

Hints are printed in the terminal. You can choose your difficulty by hiding
or revealing the terminal while playing. For extra easy difficulty you can
start using gobbledygook, nonsense words, or just hammering the keyboard like
you always wanted.
